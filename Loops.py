n = int(input('Which number? ')) #Asking the user to input a number
for i in range(n): #The range gives back a series of numbers thats leading up to that number. For example, if you input 5 you will get back 0,1,2,3,4. So i will be the variable for range
        print(i**2) #Print out the square root of the ranged number.
